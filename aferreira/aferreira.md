## About me:
[
Sometimes I wonder: what if I had chosen agriculture? Would this decision have led me down different paths? Would dedicating my life to grapes, oranges, or apples have gotten me where I am no matter what? I worked as a carpenter, electrician and teacher.  Being a teacher almost defined me, but then I finished my degree in electrical engineering and computers and followed another path. I chose to create my own business dedicated to solutions for smart buildings. Apparently I chose electrical engineering and computer science above all else, although that doesn’t define me. Other apples and lately also some penguins, I believe it is what I do with my knowledge that will define me. I will always remember that one day I was a carpenter and electrician,…

Sharing my knowledge is my true destiny and passion. That’s why my motto.

Traveling would definitely have to be part of any option.
